Hi, I'm Chenxi Yang, a first-year Ph.D at University of Texas at Austin. I gained a bachelor at Fudan University in 2019. In Fudan, I have been a research assistant in the Mobile Systems and Networking (MSN) group since 2016, advised by Prof. Yang Chen. I visited Peking University (in 2017) as a research intern, supervised by Prof. Chenren Xu.
