Hi, I'm Chenxi Yang, a Ph.D. student at the University of Texas at Austin. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Swarat Chaudhuri](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat/). Before that, I did my undergraduate at Fudan University in 2019, advised by [Prof. Yang Chen](https://chenyang03.wordpress.com/). I visited Peking University as a research assistant, supervised by [Prof. Chenren Xu](http://soar.group/chenren/). 

My research interests span the areas of programming language and machine learning. I am interested in building the tools and techniques which help the interpretability and efficiency of program learning.
