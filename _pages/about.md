Hi, I'm Chenxi Yang, a first-year Ph.D. at University of Texas at Austin. <!-- I am working with [Prof. Lili Qiu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lili/) in UT-Austin. --> I gained a bachelor at Fudan University in 2019. <!-- In Fudan, I have been a research assistant in the Mobile Systems and Networking (MSN) group since 2016, advised by [Prof. Yang Chen](https://chenyang03.wordpress.com/). I visited Peking University (in 2017) as a research intern, supervised by [Prof. Chenren Xu](http://soar.group/chenren/).  -->
