Hi, I'm Chenxi Yang, a Ph.D. student in the Trishul group at the University of Texas at Austin. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Swarat Chaudhuri](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat/). My research interests span the areas of programming language, formal methods and machine learning. I am interested in building the tools and techniques which help the interpretability and efficiency of program learning. 

Prior to graduate school, I did my undergraduate at Fudan University, advised by [Prof. Yang Chen](https://chenyang03.wordpress.com/). I visited Peking University as a research assistant, supervised by [Prof. Chenren Xu](http://soar.group/chenren/). 
<!-- My probably out-of-date CV is available [here](https://cxyang1997.github.io/files/CV_ChenxiYang.pdf). -->

I like hiking, playing badminton, swimming and board games.
